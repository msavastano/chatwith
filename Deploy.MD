## Deploying

Before you can deploy, you'll need to do some setup with AWS:

- First [install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- Then [follow the Architect setup instructions](https://arc.codes/docs/en/guides/get-started/detailed-aws-setup).

If you make it through all of that, you're ready to deploy!

1. build the app for production:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy with `arc`

   ```sh
   arc deploy production
   ```

You're in business!
